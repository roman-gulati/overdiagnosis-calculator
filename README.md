# `Overdiagnosis calculator`

A shiny app to explore the `overdiag` package

The app illustrates a deterministic model to project disease incidence in
population and trial settings. The projections can be used to examine bias in
empirical estimates of overdiagnosis and/or determine the first time point at
which empirical estimates are unbiased.
